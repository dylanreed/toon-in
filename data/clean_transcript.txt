One of my favorite things to do is to tell people about things that I like. This is fun because people underestimate how much I love Taylor Swift. I think she is wonderful and I think her music is pretty great and I listen to it all the time. Since the pandemic started and finished, my Spotify rap has been 99% Taylor and 1% other, so you might say that I am a fan. The other thing I like is talking about what I enjoy reading. For the longest time, I read fantasy and sci-fi exclusively. I started to drift into Romantic and that led me to romance books. And I love them. I love them so much I have always read a lot, but I would say that my reading consumption has doubled or more since I started reading romance. I am a sucker for a love story. Like most people, what I read growing up was heavily influenced by my parents and brother. Being the youngest, I always wanted to read what they were reading. It wasn't until I was an adult like in my late 30s that I realized that the stories that I enjoyed the most had romantic subplots. So I thought what if the romance was the plot? And it went downhill from there. What do you like to read?
