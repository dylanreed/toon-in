"Hello friends, Its me Hurly and I want to talk about mental health. As someone who has the adhd/anxiety duet of mental illnesses I have found that it is hard to talk about and even harder to have people take you seriously while having those conversations. But with the Olympics and the focus on athletes that are focusing on their mental illness I thought it would be due a good topic to talk about. 
What has really stuck with me is how strong the athletes are being by sharing their struggles and the acceptance and that they are receiving from the world at large. This is very different from my experience as a non-athlete having a struggle with mental illness. It was about three-ish years ago that I had a mental breakdown from the stress of working in healthcare during the pandemic. 
I needed up taking a month of leave to get my brain back into working order. When I returned my bosses shamed me for “abandoning” the people I worked with. This immediately sent me into a spiral. Luckily I had an amazing support squad that helped me not go back into the depths of despair that I had been in. 
What we need is acceptance of people’s mental health struggles like we are willing to accept the mental health struggles of celebrity. This along with the ability for people to get the help that they need without hardship. 
The Cost of Mental Illness
I live in the United States and healthcare here sucks. There is also a push to work all the time in order to be successful. Both those things need to change for things to get better. 
According to a quick google search 19% of adults living in the United States suffer from some for of mental illness.. That are about 51 million people. If I assume that I am an average American for cost of getting care for mental health care WITH INSURANCE  it costs about $25 a day to treat. This is for psych visits and medications. This doesn’t include any modifications to my daily routine that help me be successful. This means that for every hour that I work at a 40 hour a week job, four dollars are just to pay for my brain to work good. 
Before taxes (again according to a quick google search) the average yearly salary in the United States is $63,752 which is an hourly rate of $30.67. If you figure about 1/3 of that goes to taxes you are left with $20.42, and then you take away your brain work good number and you end up with $16 an hour to live on. That is only $33,000 for a year. Now you just have to pay the rest of your bills (including health insurance that barely covers any of your mental health needs..
That is how much it costs to have two mental illnesses that are fairly common. It is no surprise that most people have untreated mental illness. 
The Stigma of Mental Illness
Ever since I was diagnosed with ADHD I have been very open about it with both friends and employers. This is uncommon as most people fear being passed over for promotions or jobs because of their mental illness (which would be super illegal but also super hard to prove). 
This leads to people not getting support or modifications to their jobs in order to be successful. For me this led to a lot of panic and stress because I didn’t know how to ask for help and when I did ask for help it was met with my supervisors not understand what modifications I might need.
So many of my fellow adhd’rs are in the same boat. ADHD is treated as a child’s disease that you should grow out of. It shouldn’t be a struggle for you to adjust how you do things to fit in with the more near-typical way of doing things. Never mind that most people aren’t willing to understand how our brains work. 
This is frustrating to experience because businesses are (usually) very good about making modifications to job duties for physical disabilities and illnesses.  
Solution
 There isn’t one. At least not an easy one. Until we start treating mental health as health issues instead of mental issues we are kind of stuck in this cycle. So it is up to individuals to craft their life around what works for them. 
For those of us with ADHD this means getting diagnosed and taking meds to help your brain work. I have spoken to so many people who I (as a non-medical professional) would say have ADHD. But they are afraid to get diagnosed because of the stigma around having a diagnosis. Just because you get a dx doesn’t mean you have to tell anyone else. But if you know what is going on in your brain you can figure out how to work with it. 
If you are like me you have spent a lot of your life fighting with your brain. Getting diagnosed and getting medications you will find yourself working in concert with your brain. That is an emotional moment when you finally have a day when your brain isn’t fighting you. 
Depending on your doctor and insurance situation getting a diagnosis can be a paint in the ass. The best thing to do is to do a bunch of research and find a doctor that specializes in ADHD. Be honest with the do and don’t be ashamed or afraid. You are doing what is best for you. Once you have done that follow their advice. Don’t follow the advice of random on the internet (including me).
Unfortunately once you have a dx you have to figure out your drugs. This is not a magical thing, this is a lot of trial and error. Which sucks. But everyone’s body is different so what works for me may not work for you. And the same goes for everyone. So try what the doc thinks and be honest with yourself about how it is working. And if it isn’t working tell your doc and try something else. 
Don’t be scared
There are a lot of people going through the same thing. You can find a lot of great support groups online and in person. You are not alone. I know that it feels that way at times but don’t isolate yourself. You are worthy and your are great. In all seriousness - reach out if you need to. My DMs are open  and I am always happy to chat.
